I wanted to make a website for the first project on a business that sells skateboards. I wanted to make it visually appealing and easy to use in functionality.

The 3 pages are able to be asscessible from the use of the navbar. 

I used Html, Css, and Bootstrap to complete the website

Some future improvements to the website would be so space out the pictures of skateboards better and to clean up the images. I would also like to add another page for accessories for skateboards
